# HISE Tutorial repository

This is the repository for the example project from the [HISE Tutorial](http://hise.audio/manual/Tutorial1.php). 
It contains the HISE project folder as well as a .gitignore file.

In order to use it, just clone it somewhere, **build the latest HISE version** 
(important, this repository is only compatible with the latest tip) and open the `MusicBox.xml` file using the **File -> Load XML Preset Backup** function. (There are a few other patches that demonstrate additional features like sample map loading etc).

This project is supposed to be compilable on every platform / format so let me know if something breaks or doesn't work.
