# HISE Tutorial repository

This is the repository for the example project (and a few other example projects) from the [HISE Tutorial](http://hise.audio/manual/Tutorial1.php). 
It contains the HISE project folder as well as a .gitignore file.

## How to open the project

1. Clone this repository
2. [Build the latest HISE version](https://github.com/christophhart/HISE/blob/master/README.md#how-to-compile-hise) (important, this repository might not be compatible with anything else than the latest tip)
3. Open HISE and load the project with **File->Load Project**. Select the project folder that you want to load:
   - *HISE Project* for the Tutorial
   - *SimpleFX* for a simple FX plugin project that can be exported as Audio effect.
4. Load the instrument from the XML file using the **File -> Load XML Preset Backup** function.

These projects are supposed to be compilable on every platform / format so let me know if something breaks or doesn't work. If it doesn't work please make sure you are using the latest HISE version (and the latest source code).
