# HISE Tutorial repository

This is the repository for the example project (and a few other example projects) from the [HISE Tutorial](http://hise.audio/manual/Tutorial1.php). 
It contains the HISE project folder as well as a .gitignore file.

## How to open the project

1. Clone this repository
2. Build the latest HISE version (important, this repository is only compatible with the latest tip)
3. Open HISE and load the project with **File->Load Project**. Select the project folder that you want to load:
   - *HISE Project* for the Tutorial
   - *SimpleFX* for a simple FX plugin project that can be exported as Audio effect.
4. Load the instrument from the XML file using the **File -> Load XML Preset Backup** function.

These project is supposed to be compilable on every platform / format so let me know if something breaks or doesn't work.
